# App.geo.ca-v2

This project uses the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework and [SST](https://sst.dev/) to build and deploy to AWS a full-stack application for searching and cataloging geospatial data.

## Setup

- Create a fork of the app.geo.ca-v2 repo for your personal development environment.
- Clone the repo in your dev environment using the following command in a new Linux terminal: `git clone <Your-forked-repo-url>`.
- Check to make sure node, npm, and nvm are installed with these commands:
  - `node -v`
  - `npm -v`
  - `nvm -v`
- If you get an error message for any of these commands, you will have to install the packages with these steps:
  - First install curl as a sudo user: `sudo apt-get install curl`.
  - Next install nvm: `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash`.
  - Test to make sure nvm installed successfully: `command -v nvm`. Note: If successful, `nvm` will print. If nothing happens or an error is received, close and open a new terminal.
  - Next, install the latest stable version of node and npm: `nvm install --lts`. Note: A Node.js version that matches the `.nvmrc` may be required instead of the latest version. You can adjust the nvm install command by specifying the node version like this: `nvm install 18.20.8`. Replace the number with the correct version.
  - Confirm node and npm were installed: `node -v` and `npm -v`.
  - Check to make sure the correct version of npm is set as indicated by the `.nvmrc` file. See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
- Navigate to your project's directory: `cd app.geo.ca-v2`. Note: the name of your directory may differ based on the name of your forked repo.
- Install node packages with: `npm i`.
- Navigate to the `/packages/web-app/` directory using `cd packages/web-app`.
- Install node packages here too with: `npm i`.

## Developing

After following the setup, start a development server with these steps:

- Set up your AWS credentials. [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
- Create a stage env file by copying `.env.example` to `.env.<your-stage-name>` (for local dev use `.env.dev`).
- `packages/web-app/.env` is an optional local override file for web-app runtime values read from `process.env` (for example `GEOCORE_API_DOMAIN`, `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_URL`, and `USER_TABLE_NAME`).
- Keep auth/stage settings (`OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OIDC_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`) in your stage env file at the repository root (for example `.env.dev`).
- Optional scope policy setting: `OIDC_REQUESTED_SCOPES` (space/comma delimited; supported: `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `phone`, `language`).
- `packages/web-app/.env` is ignored by git and should stay local to your machine.
- Set the values for `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` from your OIDC app client.
- Set `OIDC_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` to the base auth host only (no `/oauth2` suffix), for example `https://auth.login-connexion.alpha.canada.ca`.
- If `OIDC_REQUESTED_SCOPES` is not set, the app defaults to `openid`.
- Ensure login and logout URLs are configured in your OIDC provider app client (CanadaLogin/Cognito).
  - Allowed callback URLs.
    - http://localhost:8080/sign-in/receive
  - Allowed sign-out URLs.
    - http://localhost:8080/sign-in/logout
  - Back-channel logout URL.
    - http://localhost:8080/sign-in/back-channel-logout
- Local sign-out skips provider logout and clears app cookies directly to avoid back-channel logout failures against localhost.

- For local development, run `npm run dev` from the repository root. SST v4 starts the multiplexer and frontend together.

### OIDC Authentication: client_secret_post vs. private_key_jwt

**Local development** uses `client_secret_post` authentication, where the client sends `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` in the token request body. This is simpler for local setup without requiring AWS infrastructure.

**Staging and production** use `private_key_jwt` authentication (RFC 7523), where the client signs a JWT with a private key and sends it as a client assertion. This is more secure and avoids transmitting secrets in request bodies.

When `OIDC_USE_PRIVATE_KEY_JWT=true`, non-local environments fail closed if a private key is unavailable. In that case, the app refuses `client_secret_post` fallback during token exchange.

#### Staging/Production: Setting Up private_key_jwt

1. **Generate an RSA key pair** (one-time setup):

Run this step in Bash, Git Bash, or WSL. If you're using PowerShell, `openssl` must be installed and available on your `PATH` first.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048
openssl req -key private-key.pem -new -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.crt
```

If `openssl` is not recognized in your shell, install OpenSSL or switch to a shell that already provides it before continuing.

PowerShell 7+ alternative:

```powershell
$rsa = [System.Security.Cryptography.RSA]::Create(2048)
Set-Content -Path private-key.pem -Value $rsa.ExportPkcs8PrivateKeyPem()
$certificateRequest = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.CertificateRequest]::new(
  'CN=oidc-private-key-jwt',
  $rsa,
  [System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithmName]::SHA256,
  [System.Security.Cryptography.RSASignaturePadding]::Pkcs1
)
$certificate = $certificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned(
  [System.DateTimeOffset]::UtcNow.AddMinutes(-5),
  [System.DateTimeOffset]::UtcNow.AddDays(365)
)
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes('certificate.crt', $certificate.Export([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509ContentType]::Cert))
$certificate.Dispose()
$rsa.Dispose()
```

If you already have a PEM private key named `private.key`, the OpenSSL command provided by the OIDC provider is:

```powershell
openssl req -key private.key -new -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.crt
```

Windows note: if you want to keep using the Bash commands, install OpenSSL for Windows and make sure the `openssl` executable is on your `PATH` before running them.

2. **Register the key material with your OIDC provider**:

- Log into your OIDC provider console (CanadaLogin).
- In the app client settings, upload the JWT certificate from `certificate.crt` if the provider requires a certificate instead of a raw public key.
- If a partner explicitly asks for a raw public key file, export it from your private key when needed.
- Verify that `private_key_jwt` is enabled as a supported authentication method.

3. **Store the private key in AWS Secrets Manager**:

Create the secret the first time:

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name <stage>/oidc/private-key \
  --secret-string file://private-key.pem \
  --region ca-central-1
```

If the secret already exists, update it with a new value:

```bash
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
  --secret-id <stage>/oidc/private-key \
  --secret-string file://private-key.pem \
  --region ca-central-1
```

PowerShell equivalents:

```powershell
# First-time create
aws secretsmanager create-secret `
  --name staging/oidc/private-key `
  --secret-string file://private-key.pem `
  --region ca-central-1

# Update existing secret value
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value `
  --secret-id staging/oidc/private-key `
  --secret-string file://private-key.pem `
  --region ca-central-1
```

4. **Configure your staging/production deployment**:

- Create your stage env file (for example `.env.staging` or `.env.production`) with:
  ```
  OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<your-stage-client-id>
  OIDC_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=<your-stage-oidc-domain>
  OIDC_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET_ID=<stage>/oidc/private-key
  OIDC_USE_PRIVATE_KEY_JWT=true
  ```

  - `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` is optional when `private_key_jwt` is enabled and key material is configured.
  - `OIDC_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET_ID` may be set as either a secret name/id (for example `<stage>/oidc/private-key`) or a full Secrets Manager ARN.
  - Staging/production deployments fail fast when private_key_jwt is enforced and `OIDC_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET_ID` is missing or malformed.
  - The app only fetches the private key from Secrets Manager when `OIDC_USE_PRIVATE_KEY_JWT=true`.
  - Leave `OIDC_USE_PRIVATE_KEY_JWT` unset or `false` in `.env.dev` to keep local development on `client_secret_post`.

5. **Deploy**:

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage prod
```

The Lambda execution role receives automatic permission to read the secret from Secrets Manager.

#### Local Development: Staying on client_secret_post

- `.env.dev` should **not** set `OIDC_USE_PRIVATE_KEY_JWT` or `OIDC_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET_ID`.
- Sign-in will use `client_secret_post` with `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- No AWS Secrets Manager calls are made on localhost.
- Localhost (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`) is the only environment where `client_secret_post` fallback remains permitted while `OIDC_USE_PRIVATE_KEY_JWT=true`.

- Port cleanup behavior: before frontend dev starts, `/packages/web-app/scripts/kill-port.js` runs via `predev` and force-kills listeners on port `8080`.
- Warning: this can terminate any application currently using port `8080`, not just this project.
- Validate restored sign-in flow:
  - As a guest, favourite one or more records.
  - Click Sign in and complete authentication.
  - Confirm guest favourites are merged into the signed-in profile.
  - Confirm Sign out clears session and returns to map browser.
- Optional DB diagnostics (non-production only): open `/api/health/db` and confirm `tableAccessible: true`.
- For deployment, run `npx sst deploy --stage <yourStageName>`. You will need to deploy your environment in order to build any AWS resources like buckets and tables.
- Now run the steps under [## Importing Data](#importing-data).

## Auth Flow Endpoints

CanadaLogin registration worksheet:

- See `docs/canadalogin-oidc-rp-registration-matrix.md` for environment-by-environment form values and submission checklist.
- See `docs/canadalogin-advanced-capabilities-assessment.md` for optional advanced OIDC/JOSE capability posture and recommendations.
- See `docs/canadalogin-oidc-rp-submission-answers.md` for copy/paste form answers by environment.

Core auth routes used by the app:

- `/${lang}/sign-in/send`: starts OIDC sign-in (PKCE + nonce), then redirects to the provider authorize URL.
- `/sign-in/receive`: handles the provider callback, verifies ID token claims/signature, stores auth cookies, and merges guest favourites.
- `/${lang}/sign-in/oidc-logout`: redirects to provider logout when applicable.
- `/${lang}/sign-in/logout` and `/sign-in/logout`: clear local auth cookies and redirect to map browser.
- `/sign-in/back-channel-logout`: receives provider back-channel logout notifications and stores revocation markers server-side.

Session invalidation behavior:

- Front-channel logout clears browser cookies immediately.
- Back-channel logout updates `authRevokedAt` in DynamoDB for the user.
- Back-channel logout tracks the most recent logout token `jti` and treats duplicate `jti` values within a short window as idempotent replays.
- On subsequent reads, token `iat` is compared against `authRevokedAt`; revoked sessions are treated as signed out and cookies are cleared.

Auth telemetry behavior:

- Token exchange, OIDC discovery, JWKS fetch/signature verification, and ID token verification failures emit structured server logs with a correlation id, endpoint category, and non-sensitive diagnostics.

UserInfo endpoint posture:

- The current auth flow uses verified ID token claims and does not call the OIDC UserInfo endpoint.
- This should be revisited only if CanadaLogin compliance testing or product requirements require UserInfo-specific claims.

## User Data Model

For signed-in users, the DynamoDB users table stores:

- `uuid`: stable user identifier from the auth token (`sub`, with `username` fallback).
- `favourites`: array of dataset record ids saved by the user.
- `mapConfigs`: array of saved map configurations for the Maps tab in Favourites.
- `authRevokedAt`: server-side revocation marker (token `iat` threshold) used for back-channel logout.

Not stored by current app code:

- OIDC tokens or session secrets.
- User profile attributes such as email or display name.
- Generic timestamps, TTL fields, or audit metadata beyond `authRevokedAt`.

Guest favourites are stored temporarily in the `guest_favourites` cookie and merged into the signed-in user's `favourites` list after authentication.

Favourites feature routes:

- `/${lang}/favourites`: Landing page (hub) for signed-in users; displays cards to navigate to datasets and maps sections.
- `/${lang}/favourites/datasets`: Displays list of saved dataset records with options to delete or view on the map.
- `/${lang}/favourites/maps`: Displays list of saved map configurations with options to upload, download, delete, or view on the map.
- `/${lang}/favourites/view`: Shared map viewer for displaying selected datasets (by record IDs) or a single saved map configuration (by mapId).
- `/[lang]/api/favourites`: RESTful API endpoints (POST/DELETE/PUT/PATCH) for favourites and map config mutations.

Data persistence:

- Dataset favourites: array of record IDs stored in `UserData.favourites`.
- Saved map configs: array of `MapConfigFavourite` objects stored in `UserData.mapConfigs` (max 25 configs; each config size-limited to stay within 300KB DynamoDB item limit).

## Building and deploying

- Set up your AWS credentials for the desired environment. [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
- Create a stage env file by copying `.env.example` to `.env.<your-stage-name>`.
- Keep auth/stage settings (`OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OIDC_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`) in the root stage env file for the deployment target.
- `packages/web-app/.env` remains optional local-only overrides for web-app runtime values and is git-ignored.
- From `/`, run `npm i`.
- From `/packages/web-app/`, run `npm i`. A Node.js version that matches the `.nvmrc` may be required.
- Ensure login and logout URLs are configured in your OIDC provider app client.
  - Example allowed callback URLs.
    - https://d28mialgy1tfmv.cloudfront.net/sign-in/receive
  - Example allowed sign-out URLs.
    - https://d28mialgy1tfmv.cloudfront.net/sign-in/logout
  - Example back-channel logout URL.
    - https://d28mialgy1tfmv.cloudfront.net/sign-in/back-channel-logout

- Deploy from the root of the repository: `npx sst deploy --stage <yourStageName>`.

## Importing Data

Do the following while your project's server is running:

- From AWS, go to your S3 bucket list and find the bucket with a name like this: `<your-stage-name>-<your-project-name>-site-hnapbucket<some-other-random-characters>`.
- Click on the bucket name from the list to see the bucket's details.
- From the Objects tab, click on the 'Create Folder' button and create two new folders with these names:
  - `geocore`
  - `hnap`
- From the hnap folder, copy the content from the project's `data-samples` folder.
- This triggers the hnap-bridge lambda, generates the geojson records required for viewing, and stores them under `<your-bucket-name>/geojson`. Note that any record not imported this way will return a 404 when viewed.
